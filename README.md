# react-redux-3dviewer

Sample implementantion of 3Dviewer react component. It can be used, for example, to display products in full 3D.

Sample implementantion uses:

- webpack
- react + redux + redux devtools + react router
- sass loader 
- written in ES6-7 (babel fallback)
- <a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank">babylonjs</a> library for actual 3d rendering. I find it better than currently the most popular webgl library (<a href="threejs.org" target="_blank">threejs</a>). 

This project can also be used as a react-redux boilerplate project (after removing babylonjs refferencies and 3dviewer component itself)

<strong>Installation:</strong>

1. get the project from repo
2. cd to project, then npm install
3. npm start

Please not that this is still in early development. When ready I'll publish 3Dviewer component as a independent npm module.
